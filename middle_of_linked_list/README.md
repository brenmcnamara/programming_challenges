# Middle of Linked List

## Objective

Given a linked list, write a function that efficiently identifies the middle element of the linked list.

## Edge Cases

- Linked list has an even number of elements: In this case returning either element is fine.
- Linked List is empty: The function should never get a linked list that is empty. There should be at least 1 node.
